Compiler: g++

Had a lot of trouble with everything here,
the Point class works for the most part, the member functions still do not work (multiplication and division)
however all the friend functions should work.
Thought about making multiplication and division friends as I can not get them to work as members.
I could not get the cluster class to work at all, will try more later.
